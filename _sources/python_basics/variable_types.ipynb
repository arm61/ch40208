    "A *variable* is a container that Python uses to store some *data*. \n",
    "A variable may be created and then reused at a later stage in the code.\n",
    "When a variable is *assigned*, the *value* of the variable is set to some computer memory position which is indexed by the *variable name*. \n",
    "So the variable can be reused over and over by using this variable name. \n",
    "For example, the code below will assign the value `8.314` to the variable `ideal_gas_constant`, "

    "Not all variables are the same, they can have different *types*. \n",
    "Different operations will be possible depending on the type of the variable involved. \n",
    "Common variable types that are present in Python include:\n",
    "- *integers* (`int`): whole numbers (1, 0, 2, -3, etc.). There is no decimal point and they can be positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "- *floats* (`float`): all real numbers (1.0, 3.14, 0.0, -6.4), any value that can be described with a decimal point. This includes numbers in scientific notation, which are written `6.02e23`, where the `eXX` takes the place of the $\\times 10^{\\text{XX}}$. \n",
    "- *complex* (`complex`): complex numbers, which should be familiar from mathematics, such as $1 + 2i$. However, in Python, a `j` is used instead of the $i$ so $1+2i$ becomes `1 + 2j`.\n",
    "- *string* (`str`): textual information, such as a word or a sentence. These are written between single or double inverted commas, `'like this'` or `\"this\"`. `str`-type objects are contained within either double or single quotes. However, you **cannot** use a mixture of the two, e.g. `my_string = 'Hello World!\"` will return an error.\n",
    "- *boolean* (`bool`): a *logical* variable type, named for [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole) who defined an algebraic logic system in the 19th century. These may hold one of two values, `True` or `false. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise**: In an empty Jupyter Notebook investigate the creation of variables of different types, try and come up with a chemistry example for each (complex might be a bit hard but investigate the literature, for example, the scattering length of a given atom). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ideal_gas_constant` code above assigned a `float`-type variable to the name `ideal_gas_constant`. \n",
    "The `type()` function will inform you of the type of the variable that is passed as an argument.\n",
    "For example, we can use the `type()` function as shown below to get the type of the variable named `speed_of_light`, "
